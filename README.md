# Cardiovascular_Disease_Prediction
Machine Learning Course Project organized by Aj Ty v IT

## Assignment
Train a model for prediction presence or absence of cardiovascular disease based on
provided objective, examination and subjective information about a patient. Don't
forget to start with precise exploratory data analysis as it might be specifically helpful
for this kind of dataset. In the end, we expect to see the best classifier you've been able
to train with an explanation of why this one is performing so well. Adding comparison
to at least 3 other types of the classifier is required.

## Data retrieval and description
